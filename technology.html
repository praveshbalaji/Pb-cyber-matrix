                    <p class="text-lg mb-5">Security is the integral part of any mobile app design. The compiler, interpreter, and runtime environment – all have been developed in the Java programming language keeping security in mind. 
                    <br />Robust means stability and reliability. Java puts a lot of focus on testing for early potential errors, as Java compilers are able to identify several issues that could occur during first execution time in other languages. Due to the robustness, ease of use, cross-platform development capabilities, and security features, Java app development has become the first choice for the provision of Internet solutions worldwide.</p>

                    <p>Developed by Microsoft, dotNET (also known as .NET) is a framework that makes application development a bit easy task for developers. The framework supports the development as well as maintenance of modern-days applications and XML web services. dotNET offers a highly consistent object-oriented programming environment to dedicated developers and is used to build applications that can run on multiple platforms.</br>
                        This framework can be used to design, develop, compile, build and deploy a mobile application with its comprehensive range of compilers, code libraries, support programs and APIs. The varied components of dotNET aids in the development of the customized project<br />
                        .NET is widely used by developers for the creation of services and apps on multiple devices and operating systems. One of the aspects that make .NET to stand is the range of features offered by the application.</p>

There are a few big players in the industry, but Microsoft Azure is the brand that 95% of Fortune 500 companies, including Walmart, FedEx, and HP®, use for their cloud and hybrid solutions.</br>
                            Whether it’s to coordinate connections for IoT (internet of things) devices or to process massive amounts of data through AI, Microsoft Azure’s benefits are useful for businesses of all sizes.</br>

                            A strong blend of JavaScript and HTML syntax is always used, which automatically simplifies the entire process of writing code for the planned project. The JS library consists several functions including one that converts the HTML components into required functions and transforms the entire project so that it is easy to understand. </p>
